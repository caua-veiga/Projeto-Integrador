# Planning

The project must be split in 3 main areas, in order to build a better workflow.

1.	The Physical System
2.	The PID Controller
3.	The Reinforcement Learning Controller

Of those three (as far as I know) the second one is totally dependent on the success of the first one, but the third one can be started in parallel to the first (because we can build the simulated environment and train our agent). 

Building the physical system should not be the greatest challenge of our project due to the instructions given at our reference video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN3yxIBAxTA (hopefully it will work without many headaches).

I propose that we begin by gathering references (mainly in the reinforcement learning topic but also about the PID controller, and it is also a good idea to attack the chapter 18 of Hands-On…) in the following topics:

   -	Simulation Environment for Reinforcement Learning
   -	Reinforcement Learning for Drone Control (and similar problems such as the monopole control)
   -	Edge Machine Learning (eg. Tensorflow lite) 
   -	PID Controllers 

and by building the system itself. 


## 1 _ The Physical System
### Material
-	1 - 55cm Metal Bar 
-	1 - 8mm Scroll 
-	2 – Bearings
-	Few more Scrolls to build a wood support and wood base
-	2 – Brushless Motors
-	2 – Propellers 
-	2 – 20A ESC
-	1 – 12V Power Supply
-	1 – Microcontroller (we should discuss which microcontroller to use, based on our needs and price; or we just use the one the professor gives us)
-	1 – MPU6050 IMU 
-	1 – Breadboard
-	A few jumpers
