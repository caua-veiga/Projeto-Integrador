# Week 5 Roadmap

## 16/05

The sensor code is completed. We have sucessfully retrieved the raw data from its registers and converted it to usable data resorting to its datasheet. We combined both the gyroscope and accelerometer data by the means of a complimentary filter in order to get the final angle measurement. We also implemented an autocalibration function in order to correct sensor offsets.
