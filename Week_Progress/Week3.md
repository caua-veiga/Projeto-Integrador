# Last week recap

We used an Arduino Nano board to test the ESC + Brushless motor setup.

We learnt how to generate PWM outputs with Arduino code. We managed to control the motor using the code provided for ESC calibration. 

We are now able to choose bounds for the ESC input, allowing to choose motor operating point (the lower bound standing for 0% and the upper for 100% capacity). This allows us to start designing the PID control algorithm.

We tested the influence of ESC supply voltage on motor power output. Namely, we identified the minimum required DC supply voltage (6V) and have identified a table
specifying motor thrust for 11.1 V

We have decided upon the joint design and made a sketch so that our professor is able to order its fabrication.

We also decided upon the sensor we will use, and the professor has agreed to buy it. We expect to have it by the next week.

# This week objectives

We are not going to have classes this week, albeit we were offered the possibility of using lab equipment once during the week.

Since we do not have either the sensor nor the joint yet, we may use this opportunity to further test the motor control and to experiment with PID control code.

We may also measure lenghts, weights and motor thrust so that we can start working with the computer simulation.

We may also use this free week to study further on RL control algorithms and PID concepts.
