850Kv Brushless Motor for Multi Rotor QuadCopters, HexaCopters & OctoCopters

 

This is the ArduCopter multi rotor 850Kv motor which is used by most of the ArduCopter multi rotor developers. It's very reliable and even though it's a smaller motor than its counterpart the 880Kv, it delivers a very good level of thrust with the matched 10x45 propellers.

 

This 850Kv motor can be bought in a matched and ready to fly kit too, either in a Quadcopter or Hexacopter multi rotor configurations
